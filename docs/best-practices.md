# Best Practices

## Frontend Best Practices

### Code Organization
- **Component Structure**: Follow Next.js conventions with pages, components, and layout directories
- **File Naming**: Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `NavBar.jsx`) and camelCase for utility files
- **Code Splitting**: Leverage Next.js automatic code splitting features
- **State Management**: Use React hooks for simpler components and context API for global state

### Next.js & React
- Use the App Router for better routing control and nested layouts
- Implement Server Components where appropriate for better performance
- Create reusable client components with the "use client" directive
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement proper prop validation using TypeScript
- Avoid prop drilling by using composition or context
- Memoize expensive computations with useMemo and useCallback

### CSS & Styling
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes following the official documentation
- For complex components, consider using @apply directive to group common utility patterns
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Organize custom styles in separate files when they become complex

### Performance
- Implement code splitting using React.lazy() and Suspense
- Optimize images with proper sizing and formats (WebP when possible)
- Use windowing techniques for long lists (react-window)
- Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens

### Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML elements
- Maintain appropriate contrast ratios
- Include proper ARIA attributes where necessary
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Test with screen readers

## Backend Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Use MVC pattern (Models, Controllers, Routes)
- Implement middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Create separate files for routes, controllers, and services

### API Design
- Follow RESTful principles
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implement versioning (e.g., /api/v1/contact)
- Document APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI

### Security
- Implement input validation using libraries like express-validator
- Use helmet.js for securing HTTP headers
- Set up proper CORS policies
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks

### Database
- Create proper schemas with validation
- Index frequently queried fields
- Use environment variables for database connection strings
- Implement data pagination for large collections

### Error Handling
- Create consistent error response format
- Implement global error handling middleware
- Log errors properly (avoid exposing sensitive information)
- Handle async errors properly

## Development Workflow
- Use Git for version control with meaningful commit messages
- Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality (ESLint, Prettier)
- Write unit and integration tests
- Set up CI/CD pipeline if possible

## Deployment
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper logging
- Set up health check endpoints
- Consider containerization (Docker) for consistent environments
